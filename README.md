## Pre-requisites
* [Install clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp)

> clasp is a command line utility to help you develop Google Apps Script projects locally on your computer. You can use the online editor as well, but there is no git version control there.

## Introduction
Gmail Add on is a fairly new addition to what you can do with Google App Script. 
Because of how new it is, there is hardly any tutorial available to walk you through learning how to build add ons. 
After having read through almost the entire Gmail Add on documentation, I decided to share some of my learnings.

[This page](https://developers.google.com/gmail/add-ons/) is the main documentation page to learn how to build add ons. 
It contains many tutorials provided by Google to learn different things you can do with add ons. 
The only draw back is that the tutorials only show the essential code and leave it up to the user to figure out the rest of the code to get the project running. 

As I went through this entire page, I made mini-projects to document my code for future review. 
That's when I had the idea to share the code on github so that anyone can review my projects.

## How to use this repo
I strongly recommend you to first try to attempt the projects on [this page](https://developers.google.com/gmail/add-ons/) on your own. 
Come back to this repo if you are stuck or need some reference.

You can use the .json config file in the [skeleton folder](https://github.com/hdg-utd/gmail-add-tutorial/tree/master/skeleton) to setup your manifest quickly. 
It is not a complete manifest and will need additional fields based on the project.

Lastly look at the deployment folder to see how you can deploy your projects and test them.
